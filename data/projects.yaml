    This was my first hackathon project and I'm super proud I won at my first hackathon! Honestly, I had no clue what was going on, but I designed a machine learning model that allows
    users to predict daily covid cases up to 100 days. This model proved to be a winning project even though my devpost wasnt that nice yet and my presentations weren't anything
    special. Built at HackTheValley5, winning the DCP Challenge 1st Place prize amoungst 300+ participants.

    For one of my last hackathons of the year, I wanted to make a project that I can continue working on into the future, something that can do good in the hands of others. With
    the help of Mitchell, Matthew (another one, I know) and Jacky, we were able to make SafePulse. SafePulse provides users with opioid addiction relief information, live support 
    and the locations of safe injection sites and free naxolone kits. It also has an emergency response alarm that alerts emergency services of the users status, location and access
    instructions when an overdose occurs. I handled the design of the app and the implementation of Twilio. Designing such a large app for the first time was kind of scary, but with
    constructive feedback from teammates and participant input, I think it turned out quite nicely. Built at HawkHacks2022, winning 1st place overall amoungst 350 participants.

    *Sidenote* It was designed for mobile view and you can login to SafePulse with the credentials - test@email.com SafePulse4
