  things:
    As the Director of Logistics, my career journey has been nothing short of remarkable. I began as a 
    Logistics Coordinator and Workshop Host, but this year, I've stepped into the role of Director of Logistics. I've honed my skills in orchestrating
     complex and exciting events, with one standout achievement being the flawless coordination of a 
     multi-day hackathon boasting 150 participants and a lineup of prestigious sponsors.

    But my passion doesn't stop at logistics. I've also taken the lead in crafting a dynamic 
    learning experience known as the "Road to Stormhacks" program. This monthly series features a 
    diverse range of workshops and tech-related events, including everything from game development, 
    Git/GitHub mastery, and Python wizardry to data science, PowerBI, Tableau, and the world of web 
    development encompassing React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My mission is to continuously inspire 
    and empower individuals in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
