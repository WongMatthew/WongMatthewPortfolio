    I joined to help students ship, but I stayed to scale and give students opportunities. Surge has been a bit of a marathon for me — I started out running workshops and helping with logistics, and somehow ended up steering the whole ship. At first it was just booking rooms, making sure pizza showed up on time, and troubleshooting projectors (which, of course, always break five minutes before kickoff). But then StormHacks started growing, and I found myself redesigning our entire logistics system so we could actually handle hundreds of students without falling apart.

    When I stepped into the Director role, it turned into project management bootcamp. I built Notion dashboards to keep 40+ execs on the same page, set up custom spreadsheets for reimbursements, and even hacked together a CRM-ish system so sponsors didn’t get lost in someone’s inbox. It wasn’t glamorous, but suddenly we were running multi-venue hackathons like clockwork.

    Becoming President pushed things even further — it wasn’t just “get the event out the door” anymore, it was thinking about sustainability. How do we make sure Surge doesn’t implode when people graduate? So I formalized documentation, created onboarding playbooks, and pushed us to think like product teams instead of student clubs. We scaled StormHacks past 1,000 participants, launched new programs like SparkJam, and brought in over six figures in sponsorships. 

    Honestly, the fun part has been treating the whole club like a giant strategy game. I like seeing where the bottlenecks are, then figuring out how to reroute things so everyone can move faster. Surge taught me that leadership isn’t about being the loudest person in the room — it’s about making sure your team has the tools and clarity to do their best work. The fact that we pulled it off year after year still makes me kind of proud.

    At St. Paul’s I ended up wearing a lot of hats. One week I was deep in Oracle schemas, the next I was wrangling front-end quirks in plain old HTML and CSS. The finance app was the big one — I basically rebuilt it so departments didn’t need to push paper around anymore. I wired in role-based access control, row-level security (so Cardiology only sees Cardiology, Radiology only sees Radiology), and the whole package of encryption and TLS because… well, it’s a hospital, you don’t mess around with patient or billing data. That project alone saved them about $1.5M a year, which still feels wild to me.

    I also got to redo a disease research database that Harvard and St. Paul’s were sharing. It used to be a mess of hard-to-query tables; I gave it a proper schema, slapped on a friendlier UI, and tucked queries behind PL/SQL procedures so people couldn’t just poke around wherever they wanted. Researchers actually started getting answers out of it 40% faster — which, if you’ve ever sat through slow queries in a meeting, you know is life-changing.

    And then there was the invoice system, which sounds boring but was probably the most brain-twisty bit. Different forms, different input types, all needing to map back to the same invoice — classic polymorphic association headache. I modeled it out, built it in PL/SQL/Quick SQL, and made sure every insert was safe, every history was append-only. It felt more like designing a ruleset for a game than finance software, honestly. But it worked: fewer manual fixes, cleaner data, and a system that could take a beating without breaking.

    My time at BC Children’s was all about building tools that didn’t just look good on a slide deck — they actually had to work for doctors, researchers, and even families using them. The first thing I tackled was a machine learning app that tried to spot craniosynostosis in infants. We took UBC research, ran it through TensorFlow-PointNet, and wrapped it up in a Flutter app. Seeing a research paper turn into a prototype you could hold in your hand was surreal.

    I also spent a lot of time on the Digital Lab website and LivePlanBe, which were supposed to be places where non-technical staff could push out pediatric health resources without bugging a developer every time. I set up REST and GraphQL APIs, plugged everything into Strapi as a CMS, and basically gave the team the keys to update content on their own. No more “can you deploy this for me?” Slack messages — which, as a dev, felt like a small miracle.

    And of course, deployment had to be bulletproof. We had stuff running across AWS and Azure, and I stitched together GitHub Actions and Docker pipelines so pushes actually went live without someone babysitting the process. The systems ended up serving thousands of clinicians, caregivers, and patients — which meant every tiny mistake could affect real people. That pressure kept me sharp. Looking back, BC Children’s was where I really learned how to take code from “works on my laptop” to “ready for production in a hospital setting.”
