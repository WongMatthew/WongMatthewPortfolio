  things: 
    As President of SFU Surge, my role has evolved dramatically over the past year. I've led the expansion of StormHacks, growing the event to accommodate 300 participants. 
    My responsibilities included strategic meetings with CEOs and CTOs, securing them as sponsors and guest speakers, which significantly enhanced the event's profile. I've also negotiated with 
    numerous restaurants and vendors, achieving favorable pricing on food and merchandise that elevated the overall experience.

    Additionally, I've been instrumental in orchestrating various aspects of the event, from admissions and external relations to crafting a comprehensive marketing plan. 
    My involvement extended to overseeing website development, ensuring a seamless digital presence that aligns with our vision. Collaborating closely with school authorities, Major League Hacking, 
    and student societies, I've ensured that every facet of the event is synchronized and impactful.

    My commitment to fostering a thriving tech community continues as I spearhead initiatives like the "Road to StormHacks" program, enhancing learning opportunities through diverse 
    workshops and events. This role has not only deepened my expertise in managing large-scale events but also reinforced my dedication to inspiring and empowering the next generation of tech innovators.
